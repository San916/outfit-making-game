# My Personal Project

## A clothes buying and wearing simulator

For my personal project, I will be creating a clothes shopping and outfit wearing simulator. 
I wanted to make this project because I **enjoy** fashion, but I also do not like **spending** money on outfits.
Using this application, I will be able to vicariously live out the lifestyle I wish i had.

## User stories
